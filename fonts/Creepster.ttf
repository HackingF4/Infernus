This file is a placeholder for Creepster.ttf.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual TTF font file.

To complete this implementation, download the Creepster font from Google Fonts or another source and replace this file with the actual font file.

The font is also imported via Google Fonts in the CSS, so this file is optional if you have internet connection.
